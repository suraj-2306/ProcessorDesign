# RISC-V Processor Design 
The project is about implementing custom 4-stage pipeline 8 bit processor for implementing the following instructions: 
- constrant addition(addi)
- shift left logical(sll)
- unconditional jump(j)

The processor has the following stages:
- Instruction fetch
- Register file
- Execution
- Writeback
The processor also incorporates a forwarding unit to resolve hazards.
