# RISC-V Processor Design

The project is about implementing custom 4-stage pipeline 8 bit processor for implementing the following instructions:

- constrant addition(addi)
- shift left logical(sll)
- unconditional jump(j)

The processor has the following stages:

- Instruction fetch
- Register file
- Execution
- Writeback

The processor also incorporates a forwarding unit to resolve hazards.

The instrcution and their op-code is explained below:

## addi

- Usage: addi `destinationReg`, `immediateData`
- Instruction code:
  | Opcode (00) | DestReg| ImmData|
  | :----------:| :----: | :----: |
  | 7:6         |  5:3 | 2:0|
- Operation: 
  Adds the data in the `DestReg` register to the sign extended data in the `ImmData` register. 

## sll

- Usage: sll `destinationReg`, `shiftAmount`
- Instruction code:
  | Opcode (01) | DestReg| Shamt|
  | :----------:| :----: | :--: |
  | 7:6         |  5:3 | 2:0|
- Operation: 
  Left shifts the data in the register specified by the register number in the `destinationReg` field by value specified in the `shiftAmount` register


## jump

- Usage: j `labelAdd`
- Instruction code:
  | Opcode (11) | PartialJumpAdd |
  | :----------:| :----: |
  | 7:6         | 5:0|
- Operation:
  The `pc` jumps to an an address generated by adding old `pc+1` to the sign extended data specified in the field `labelAdd`

  Example execution order:
  For demonstrating the working of the processor, the following instruction were executed in the same order.

`addi R2,3 `
`sll R2,1  `
`addi R5,4 `
`jmp L1 (2)`
`sll R5,3  `
`L1: addi R1,2`
